adopted in the core Unicode character set.

However, there is a **"octopus" emoji** in **Unicode version 15.1 (released in
2023)** — specifically, it's **U+1F98B**, which is called **"octopus"** and is
officially part of the Unicode Standard.

So, to clarify:

✅ Yes, there **is** an official octopus emoji in Unicode — **U+1F98B**, known
as the **"octopus"** emoji.

It looks like this: 🐙

> Note: This emoji was added in Unicode 15.1 (2023) and is now available on
most modern platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.).

So, while it wasn't present in earlier versions, it **is now officially
recognized** in Unicode.

📌 Summary:
- **Official?** Yes (since Unicode 15.1, 2023)
- **Unicode code point:** U+1F98B

Is there a octopus emoji?
--------------------------------------------------

As of now, there is **no official octopus emoji** in the standard Unicode
emoji set.

However, there *is* a **"squid" emoji** (🦑), which is often used in a similar
way to represent an octopus, especially in casual or humorous contexts. The
squid emoji is visually similar to an octopus and is sometimes used
interchangeably, though it's technically a different creature.

In some emoji collections or platforms (like certain social media apps or
custom emoji sets), you might find a more specific octopus emoji, but it's not
part of the core Unicode emoji standard.

So, to summarize:

- ❌ No official octopus emoji in standard Unicode.
- ✅ Yes, a squid emoji (🦑) is available and often used as a substitute.

If you're looking for a more accurate octopus emoji, you might need to use a
custom or platform-specific emoji.<|im_end|>
